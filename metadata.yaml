description: 'Fantomas strikes again in this third installment in the intoxicating
  crime series. On Rue Norvins, the police find a famous heiress poisoned to death
  in the studio of a ceramics painter. The artist, in a state of partial paralysis,
  remembers nothing. These bare and baffling facts will lead newspaperman Jerome Fandor
  from the magnificent ballrooms of the aristocracy to the scrubby pubs of the Parisian
  underworld as his search for the truth uncovers ruined fortunes, desperate suicides,
  mistaken identities, and even romance. Never far from such evil and outrageous doings
  is a villain so mysterious, so extraordinary, so clever and cruel that he can only
  have one name: Fantomas! This ebook has been professionally proofread to ensure
  accuracy and readability on all devices.'
